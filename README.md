Hello. 
<br>We are IMCGAMES TOS Team. 

First of all, we would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for your contributions to the English Translation of Tree of Savior. We were able to hold our first Beta Test successfully with your help and support. 

As previously announced in Github, we wanted to clarify some issues raised regarding the copyright of translations and we have decided, from this point on, to merge pull requests only after your acceptance to Tree of Savior Contributor Agreement.
Likewise, we would also like to ask all our contributors for your agreement regarding the use of past contributions by agreeing to the Contributor Agreement.

Tree of Savior Contributor Agreement : <BR>

If you do not agree with the terms of Contributor Agreement for previous contributions, and wish to have your contributions removed, you may send your emails to tossupport@imc.co.kr with information of your previous contributions for us to have them removed from the game.

Once again, we would like to thank our contributors for your efforts and we apologize for any ambiguities that you may have experienced from using the Tree of Savior Open Text Client Repository. 


Thank you.

# Tree of Savior Open Text Client (OTC)   
Welcome to the Tree of Savior OTC Github Repository.

This repository is dedicated to translating Tree of Savior game texts from **Korean to English**. Our goal is to complete the English translations first so that it can be used to translate the game to other non-English languages. 

We hope our disclosing of game texts and opening this repository will pave a quicker way for our non-English speaking fans to enjoy the game in their native languages in the future. 

You can read about our plans for the international version of Tree of Savior in our [Dev Blog](http://blog.treeofsavior.com/en/)


## Real-Time Translation
Here's a sneak preview of how real-time translation would function in game. (may be subject to changes)

## Contributions

We welcome your contributions in form of pull requests. 

To prevent the situation where many people would translate the same lines, please comment and indicate which lines you'd be contributing to in the "Lines for Translation" issue found in the 'Issues' menu so that others would skip those lines.

You may also create new issues to discuss the translations with other translators. Please note that issues not related to translation may be deleted without notice.

#### Don't know Korean but still want to contribute?  

You can still contribute by editing translation errors :)

**Tip:** The translations should be kept as short as possible to fit in game UI.
